# FaceDetector
Face Detector app with Kotlin and Firebase ML Kit
For SDk 23+

A Basic Face Detector app which detects faces and shows the no. of detected faces in Live camera frames.
It was developed using Firebase ML kit. The Programming Language used was Kotlin.
I also created a Library in the process for displaying overlays over the detected faces in live camera frames.
